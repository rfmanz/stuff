- [ ] Data Preparation
    - [ ] Dataset
    - [ ] Metadata
        - [ ] Meta-table approach
        - [ ] Description
        - [ ] Clipping
        - [ ] Fillna
    - [ ] Preprocess
    - [ ] Report generator
        - [x] Data Waterfall (rdsutils/Datawaterfall)
    - [ ] Data splitting/generator 
        - for cross-validation or DL models
- [ ] Model Design
    - [ ] Performance definition
    - [ ] Sample design
        - mostly in lending...
        - we did apply static and dynamic sampling to account-level fraud models.
    - [ ] Segmentation
    - [ ] Reject Inference
- [ ] Model Development
    - [ ] Feature Engineering
        - Note: this needs to link back to data preparation. The design must be polynorphic in some sense.
        - One simple solution is to add unique id once and only once at data prep step, and match on that.
    - [ ] Feature Selection
        - [x] rdsutils/FeatureSelector
    - [ ] Hyper-parameter Tuning
        - [ ] all hail AutoGluon
    - [ ] Benchmarking
        - [ ] Previous model loader
        - [ ] AutoGluon!
- [ ] Model Selection
    - [ ] Performance Eval w.r.t. Benchmarks
        - [ ] rdsutils/Performance eval 
    - [ ] Model Interpretation
    - [ ] Implementation Testing
        - [ ] Pre
        - [ ] Post
    - [ ] Segmented analysis and report generation
    - [ ] Fair-lending
- [ ] Deployment
    - [ ] Proto-utils by Thomas
- [ ] Monitoring
    - [ ] SageMaker SDK 
        - [ ] Data Capturing module setup
        - [ ] Baselining
- [ ] Pipelining
    - Might be the most important factor here.
    - needs to link everything up and fault proven
    - [ ] experiment with MLFlow/Airflow/whichever SoFi ML platform is using
